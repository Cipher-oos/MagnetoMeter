# MagnetoMeter
First : Make sure that micropython is already on your RPI Pico if not follow the instructions here : https://www.raspberrypi.com/documentation/microcontrollers/micropython.html

I am using Thonny as my prefferd IDE , It's up to you 

 <strong>Parts :  </strong>
 
1- A Raspberry Pi Pico with pins soldered (pointing down)
2- A PiicoDev Magnetometer QMC6310 - Data sheet can be found here : https://datasheet.lcsc.com/lcsc/2007101835_QST-QMC6310U_C669299.pdf
3- A PiicoDev Expansion Board for Raspberry Pi Pico 
4- A PiicoDev Cable - longer cables are useful to keep your Magnetometer away from magnetic interference.
5- (Optional) A magnet

 <strong> Note : 3 and 4 can be replaced with Breadboard and Jumpers according to the circut that I used and set in the repo   </strong>
You can buy the parts online or from whatever store you chose
